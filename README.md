# project_game
This Python program uses Pygame to create a 3×3 Tic-Tac-Toe game. It draws a grid, tracks player turns, and lets users place X or O by clicking a cell. The board updates after each move, switching players automatically. The game displays marks on the screen and runs until the window is closed.
